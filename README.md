# FLY-LIKE-A-PRO
Finds the best route to travel between places using adjacency list and stack. Iterative backtracking approach.

DATA STRUCTURES USED : ADJACENCY LIST, STACK

PACKAGE ABSTRACT :

This project enables the user to find flights when flying from a city to another. If a person wishes to fly from one city to another, he/she can use this project to find the feasible routes. The routes can be sorted by time /duration of the course of flight or based on the total fare for flying from the origin to destination.

Implementation:
The primary data structure that is used in this project is a graph with all of the cities as the vertices/nodes and the flight from one city to another as an edge. The graph is implemented as an adjacency list (linked list of linked lists). For searching the routes an iterative backtracking is done with the help of a stack.All of the basic data structures that are needed for the implementation of the program such as a vector, linked list, stack, etc., has been 
implemented as well.

Working:
All of the flight details (origin, destination, fare, duration) have been uploaded in a file, from which the graph is constructed every time the program is run.The program then asks the user to enter origin and destination. Then the possible routes are searched and the program presents the top search results. The sorting factor (time/ fare) can be decided by the user and the user can also control how many routes he/she wishes to have a look at.
